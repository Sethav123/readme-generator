# README generator
## Description
made a command line application that accepts user input for a title, description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, test instructions, a license, and my github username and email address and creates a README file with corresponding sections filled in with whatever the user inputed for the prompts. It also includes a badge under the title for whichever license you selected in the prompt and a table of contents that links to each section of the README.
